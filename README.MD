= Sit Timer =

AUTHOR: Jeremy Markowitz

This windows application encourages you to stand two minutes for every twenty minutes you sit to restart your metabolism.

Use Setup.exe or compile the program in .net

The interface has two timers.  The green timer will lock your windows screen and force login when the timer reaches zero.  The idea is after twenty minutes, you log back in, start the yellow stand timer and stand until it says "you may sit."  At that point, sit down and click the green timer again.

The yellow timer does nothing when reaching zero except show you it's done.

Both timers can be configured as far as how long the countdown is.
